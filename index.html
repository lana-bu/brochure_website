            <p>
                Twinkling Meadows is a stargazer's paradise! We're located in an area with very little
                light pollution, making it possible to see the stars clearly at night. Guests stay in
                our two-story hotel which is positioned at the edge of 3 acres of open field, providing
                ample space to view the sky. To reduce the light pollution of the hotel, all lights are
                shift to producing red light only after 9 PM until 6 AM, including the street lights in
                the parking lot. Every room has two flashlights in case guests require more light. The
                windows of each room are installed with blackout curtains, making it possible for guests
                to sleep during the day and have more time to stargaze at night. We provide fully-reclining
                foldable lawn chairs as well as pillows and blankets that are washed daily for guests to
                use to keep comfortable anywhere in the field while watching the sky.

            <p>
                You can expect to see enchanting nightime sights like the Milky Way Galaxy and various
                constellations during your stay. If you visit later in the season, you can faintly see
                the Andromeda galaxy located within the Andromeda constellation in the northern sky.
                You may be lucky enough to see some shooting stars during your visit, especially if you
                stay during a meteor shower like the beautiful and exciting Perseids meteor shower that
                usually peaks in the second half of summer. We encourage you to bring a telescope if you
                have one to get close-up shots of the moon, detailed looks at planets like Saturn, and
                views of deep-sky objects like galaxies and nebulae. If not, just get cozy in a lawn chair
                and take in the sparkling wonder of our universe!
            </p>
            <p>
                We are operational from the months of May to October to take advantage of the warmer
                nights for stargazing. The field will still be open to the public during the off-season,
                but visitors will need to bring their own supplies for stargazing comfortably. Entry
                during the off-season requires a small fee of $3.00 per person to support the upkeep of 
                the field. Those not staying as guests in the hotel can also pay this fee to access the
                field during the operational months of Twinkling Meadows. Feel free to 
                <a href="#contact-section">contact us</a> if you have any questions about travel packages,
                booking, location, or accommodations. We hope to see you plan a stay at Twinkling Meadows
                soon!
